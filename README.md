<h2>
  How does it work?
</h2>

<br>

Firstly script finds which html tags include texts we need from three given sites. Then [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) fetches texts between tags and saves it in a list element.Then i used [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to make a GUI. Its that simple!
